Refrence 1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set
Fisher's Iris data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 .
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample 
the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to 
distinguish the species from each other
